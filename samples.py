colleges["UC Berkeley"]["comments"][1] = {"name" : "Hau Nguyen", "comment" : "Berkeley is tough, not going to lie.

colleges["UC Berkeley"]["comments"][2] = {"name" : "Jennifer Nguyen", "comment" : "I will begin by saying this: Berkeley is HARD. You will be challenged on a daily basis to stretch the boundaries of your understanding, and there will be little time to sit on your laurels and rest. That being said, if you maintain a reasonable courseload and a reasonable set of study habits, you can succeed.", "rating" :4.2}
colleges["UC Berkeley"]["comments"][3] = {"name" : "Juliet Tran", "comment" : "If you're worried about fitting in at a big school, don't.

colleges["UC Davis"]["comments"][2] = {"name" : "Shannon Lal", "comment" : "Don't under estimate Davis, just because we aren't in a big city, we have so many clubs that will build social ties with people! You'll never feel alone in Davis, sorta feels like a big family. ", "rating" :4.5 }
colleges["UC Davis"]["comments"][3] = {"name" : "Alan Sani", "comment" : "My experience was excellent. You have to work the school and take advantage of all it has to offer. If people did not enjoy their experience then they let the school work them in my opinion. I have been more successful than my friends who graduated from Yale, Cal, UCLA, and UCSD.", "rating" :4 }

colleges["San Jose State"]["comments"][1] = {"name" : "Mikhaela Francisco", "comment" : "For someone whose of thinking og going here, I would say that a lot of the experiences are always based on how involved you are around teh campus.

colleges["San Jose State"]["comments"][2] = {"name" : "Gabby Swanson", "comment" : "The beauty of SJSU is that it is in the bay area.

colleges["San Jose State"]["comments"][3] = {"name" : "Angelica Hayes", "comment" : "This school is super amazing! I wouldn't want to pick any other. The people here are great, the classes are okay, and the extra-cirricular activities are just outstanding. Come to SJ!", "rating" :4}

I have met so many great people and have had a lot of good experiences since attending this university. ", "rating" :4}
colleges["San Diego State"]["comments"][3] = {"name" : "Eric Snow", "comment" : "I would tell students that it is positively different from my expectations. I would also note that is a great mix of both a big and small college, depending on what you make out of it. I went in with the idea of transfering out soon, but now I 've seen how diverse the campus is. This school meets my expectations, but there are things to consider. ", "rating" :4 }

colleges["CSU Monterey Bay"]["comments"][1] = {"name" : "Erick Acedo", "comment" : "If you like the pacific breeze, the bipolar weather, and a community that does not discriminate then CSUMB is the school for you! I know that we may be small and not have your expectations, but with the community and opportunities we deliver, it can really change your envisionment of this campus.", "rating" :3.2}
colleges["CSU Monterey Bay"]["comments"][2] = {"name" : "Elijah Baird", "comment" : "It is a small school and the classrooms are, also, smal, so it is easy to talk to your professors and make connections with them, which would be less likely if you were to attend a larger school. I would prefer the over-cast that Monterey exists in. All the faculty that I've met have been dedicated to helping the students.", "rating" :3.5 }
